TOKIO Time Series Format
================================================================================

pytokio uses the TOKIO Time Series (TTS) format to serialize time series data
generated by various storage and data systems in a standardized format.  TTS
is based on the HDF5 data format and is implemented within the
:mod:`tokio.connectors.hdf5` connector.

The datasets supported by the TTS format and HDF5 connector are:

.. include:: tts_v1.inc

The TTS format strives to achieve semantic consistency in that a row that is
labeled as ``2019-07-11 03:45:05`` in a table such as:

+---------------------+------------+-----------+ 
| Timestamp           | OST0000    | OST0001   | 
+=====================+============+===========+ 
| 2019-07-11 03:45:00 | 52382342   | 98239803  | 
+---------------------+------------+-----------+ 
| 2019-07-11 03:45:05 | 23498237   | 92374926  | 
+---------------------+------------+-----------+ 
| 2019-07-11 03:45:10 | 90384233   | 19375629  | 
+---------------------+------------+-----------+ 

will contain data corresponding to the time from 3:45:05 (inclusive) to 3:45:10
(exclusive).
