TOKIO - Total Knowledge of I/O
================================================================================

This a reference implementation of the TOKIO framework composed as a Python
package.  The [full documentation][] is hosted by Read the Docs.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pytokio has a single site-specific configuration file:

    tokio/site.json

which you may wish to edit and configure to match your site's file system names
and the naming conventions.  Most of these parameters are only required for the
higher-level convenience tools, so editing this is not essential to getting
started.

Then simply

    $ pip install .
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

or

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/installdir

To create an egg file,

    $ python -c "import setuptools; execfile('setup.py')" bdist_egg

pytokio supports both Python 2.7 and 3.6 and, at minimum, requires h5py, numpy,
and pandas.  The full requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.

Quick Start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pytokio is a python library that does not do anything by itself; it provides the
APIs necessary to develop analysis routines.  However several simple utilities
are included to demonstrate how pytokio can be used.

- `bin/` directory contains useful tools implemented on top of pytokio
- `examples/` contains standalone Jupyter notebooks and scripts that illustrate
  different aspects of the pytokio API that do useful things.  They are designed
  to run on NERSC systems via https://jupyter.nersc.gov/.
- `tests/` contains unit and integration tests for the pytokio library and
   the scripts bundled in `/bin`
- `tokio/` is the importable Python package itself
