    Given a start time, end time, and template data structure that describes a
    pattern by which the files of interest are indexed, locate all existing
    files that fall between the start and end time.

    The template argument (`template`) are paths that are passed through
    `datetime.strftime` and then checked for existence for every `timedelta`
    increment between `start` and `end`, inclusive.  `template` may be one
    of three data structures:

        - str: search for files matching this template
        - list of str: search for files matching each template.  If
          ``match_first`` is True, only the first hit per list item per time
          interval is returned; otherwise, every file matching every template
          in the entire list is returned.
        - dict: use ``lookup_key`` to determine the element in the dictionary
          to use as the template.  That value is treated as a new ``template``
          object and can be of any of these three types.

    Args:
        start (datetime.datetime): Begin including files corresponding to this
            start date, inclusive.
        end (datetime.datetime): Stop including files with timestamps that
            follow this end date.  Resulting files _will_ include this date.
        template (str, list, or dict): Template string(s) which should be passed
            to datetime.strftime to be converted into specific time-delimited
            files.
        lookup_key (str or None): When `type(template)` is dict, use this key to
            identify the key-value to use as template.  If None and `template` is
            a dict, iterate through all values of `template`.
        match_first (bool): If True, only return the first matching file for
            each time increment checked.  Otherwise, return _all_ matching
            files.
        timedelta (datetime.timedelta): Increment to use when iterating between
            `start` and `end` while looking for matching files.

    Returns:
        list: List of strings, each describing a path to an existing HDF5 file
        that should contain data relevant to the requested start and end dates.
